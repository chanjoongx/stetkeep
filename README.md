## ⚡ 30-second install

```bash
npx stetkeep install
```

This is the one-command minimal install: protocols, subagents, slash commands, path-scoped rules. Next session of `claude`, type `/brain-scan` and you're working.

For full mechanical enforcement (hooks + permissions deny-lists), the **Install** section below has a two-step recommended flow: one extra `cp` command.

Full walkthrough: [`BOOTSTRAP_GUIDE.md`](BOOTSTRAP_GUIDE.md).

---

## 🎯 What stetkeep actually is

Two things other Claude Code projects don't ship:

### 1. **XML-structured protocol framework**

Prose prompts ("be careful when refactoring, prefer readability over cleverness...") don't survive 20K-token contexts. XML-tagged directives do. [Anthropic's own prompting guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags) recommends XML tags explicitly as a way for Claude to parse prompts more accurately. We built three protocols around it:

- **BRAIN.md** — `<routing>` / `<mode>` / `<inhibit>` — decides where a command goes
- **CRAFT.md** — `<anti_patterns>` / `<safety_net>` / `<false_positives>` — structural refactor discipline
- **PERF.md** — `<pre_check>` / `<perf_budget>` / `<measurement_gate>` — measurement-first performance work

Each is ~1.8K tokens. Claude's attention lands on XML-delimited sections more reliably than on Markdown prose headers.

### 2. **False-positive catalog**

The 16-entry registry of "patterns Claude will mistakenly flag as problems." Examples:

| What Claude sees | What Claude will say | What it actually is |
|---|---|---|
| 1000-line `constants.js` | "God File (A1). Split it." | A data table. Splitting loses context. |
| Deliberate inline `for` loop | "Duplication (A3). Extract." | Profiled hot path. 10× faster than `reduce`. |
| Plain `<img>` element | "Use `next/image`." | Below-fold. Not the LCP element. |
| `Array.map().map().map()` | "Collapse into `reduce`." | V8 optimizes this; readability wins. |

When Claude matches one of these, the Safety Net flags it 🔴 Low confidence and asks before editing. Catalog is under `<false_positives>` in CRAFT.md and PERF.md.

No competitor ships this.

---

## 🛡 Supporting layer — hook-enforced Safety Net

On top of the XML framework, stetkeep ships a five-layer defense:

- **Layer A** — `permissions.deny` hard-blocks edits to `legacy/`, `generated/`, `vendor/` (deterministic)
- **Layer B** — PreToolUse hook runs out-of-process; returns `deny`/`ask`/`allow` JSON (deterministic)
- **Layer C** — Subagent tool scoping — `craft-specialist` / `perf-specialist` can't `Write` new files (structural)
- **Layer D** — Path-scoped rules auto-load CRAFT/PERF on `src/**` file access (heuristic)
- **Layer E** — XML protocols + false-positive catalog (heuristic)

Layers A / B / C fire regardless of model attention. Layers D / E bias behavior. Honest breakdown in [`ARCHITECTURE.md §1`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

This part is **not novel** — [TDD-Guard](https://github.com/nizos/tdd-guard), [claude-guardrails](https://github.com/dwarvesf/claude-guardrails), and others already ship hook-based enforcement. stetkeep's wedge is the XML framework + FP catalog above; hooks are just the vehicle.

## 📦 Install

### Quickstart (1 step, minimal)

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
npx stetkeep install
```

Gets you the XML protocols, subagents, slash commands, and path-scoped rules (Layers C/D/E). Enforcement is prompt-level only: the model biases toward the Safety Net but cannot be mechanically blocked.

### Recommended (2 steps, full mechanical enforcement)

After `npx stetkeep install`:

```bash
cp .claude/settings.example.json .claude/settings.json
```

> **If you already have `.claude/settings.json`** (from other tooling or a previous install): `cp` will overwrite it. Run `ls .claude/settings.json` first; if it exists, merge the `permissions` and `hooks.PreToolUse` blocks from `settings.example.json` manually instead of overwriting.

This wires up the remaining two layers:

- **Layer A** (permissions deny-list): hard-blocks edits to `legacy/`, `generated/`, `vendor/`
- **Layer B** (PreToolUse hook): out-of-process Safety Net enforcement on every Edit / Write / Bash

Without this step, `legacy/` protection is a prompt suggestion rather than a deterministic block. You keep the same protection surface the project was designed around by completing it.

### Then launch

```bash
claude
```

Inside Claude Code:
```
/brain-scan
```

### `npx stetkeep install` modes

- `--mode coexist` (default): preserve everything, append 3-line bootstrap to CLAUDE.md
- `--mode merge`: same + add a Protocols reference section
- `--mode fresh`: empty-project install (requires `--force` if anything exists)
- `--dry-run`: preview without writing

### Alternative: Claude Code plugin marketplace

```
# In Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add chanjoongx/stetkeep
/plugin install stetkeep
```

Auto-loads subagents, commands, and the hook with no file copying into your project. Tradeoff: path-scoped rules (Layer D) and root-level protocol MDs cannot be packaged by the plugin spec, so they stay user-level. For the full experience use `npx stetkeep install`.

### Alternative: clone + script (for hacking on stetkeep)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chanjoongx/stetkeep.git
cd /path/to/your-project
bash /path/to/stetkeep/install.sh
```

The `install.sh` is a thin wrapper over `node lib/install.js`. Use this only if you are modifying stetkeep itself.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- **Claude Code 2026+** (hooks, subagents, path-scoped rules, slash commands all require this)
- **Node 20+** (bundled with Claude Code — you have it)
- **bash** on macOS/Linux; **Git Bash** (recommended) or **PowerShell** on Windows
- **jq** (optional — hook falls back to grep if absent)

> **Windows note**: macOS/Linux/Git Bash is the primary test surface. The `safety-net.ps1` PowerShell hook ships but has less field data; if hooks misbehave on native PowerShell, `npx stetkeep install` is the shortest recovery path (bypasses ExecutionPolicy + avoids the WSL `bash.exe` proxy).

---

## ⚖ vs. the 2026 ecosystem

Honest comparison, based on [competitive research](https://github.com/chanjoongx/stetkeep/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md):

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | XML protocols + FP catalog | TDD-specific blocking | Security permissions | Subagent library | Kitchen-sink toolkit |
| **Stars (Apr 2026)** | v0.4.0 launch | 2K | 12 | 17.7K | 160K |
| **Hook enforcement** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Tool-scoped subagents** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **XML-structured protocols** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **False-positive catalog** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Plugin marketplace** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **npm package** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

If you want **TDD-specific blocking** → TDD-Guard. If you want **security policy as code** → claude-guardrails. If you want **an agent library** → VoltAgent. If you want **everything at once** → everything-claude-code.

If you want **a protocol framework with a curated false-positive registry**, that's us.

## 🎯 Verify it works

> Checks 1-3 assume the `npx stetkeep install` flow, which copies files into your project's `.claude/`. Plugin-marketplace installs register the artifacts from Claude Code's own plugin directory, so `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/hooks/` will be empty in your project; in that case skip to check 4.

```bash
# 1. Hook runs and returns decisions
echo '{"tool_name":"Edit","tool_input":{"file_path":"legacy/x.ts"}}' \
  | bash .claude/hooks/safety-net.sh

# Expected (JSON):
# {"hookSpecificOutput":{"permissionDecision":"ask", ...}}

# 2. Subagents discoverable
ls .claude/agents/
# brain-router.md  craft-specialist.md  perf-specialist.md

# 3. Slash commands (after restarting claude)
# In Claude Code, type `/` — you should see /brain-scan, /craft-audit, /perf-audit

# 4. Quick diagnostic (works in both install modes)
npx stetkeep scan
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Windows PowerShell execution policy blocks install.ps1
Use `npx stetkeep install` instead (npm bypasses the .ps1 policy entirely). Or:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
```

### PowerShell renders em-dashes (`—`) as `??`
Cosmetic only on Korean / CP949 consoles. Run `chcp 65001` first, or just ignore — the install is correct.

### `bash` in PowerShell tries to invoke WSL
That's Windows's built-in `bash.exe` (WSL proxy), not Git Bash. Use `npx stetkeep install` (no bash dependency) or open Git Bash directly from the Start menu.

### Hook doesn't seem to do anything
Verify the hook returns JSON:
```bash
echo '{"tool_name":"Edit","tool_input":{"file_path":"legacy/x.ts"}}' | bash .claude/hooks/safety-net.sh
```
If no output: make sure `.claude/settings.json` exists (copy from `settings.example.json`) and the hook is wired under `hooks.PreToolUse`.

### `/brain-scan` not recognized
Claude Code 2026+ required. Older versions don't scan `.claude/commands/`. Check with `claude --version`.

## 🧪 Benchmark

We publish a pre-registered evaluation spec instead of hand-wavy numbers:

📄 [`benchmark/SPEC.md`](benchmark/SPEC.md) — 50 test cases, 3 conditions (vanilla / stetkeep full / stetkeep Safety-Net-only), human rubric grading (Cohen's κ ≥ 0.75), paired bootstrap statistics, `~$18–25` per full run on Opus 4.7 (April 2026 pricing).

Results pending. We'll publish data + methodology, not a single percentage.

## ❓ FAQ

### Does the Safety Net actually work, or is it prompting theater?
Layers A (permissions) and B (hook) are out-of-process and deterministic — they block edits before the tool fires, regardless of what Claude decided. Layer C (subagent tool scoping) is enforced at spawn — the tool simply isn't available. Layers D (path-scoped rules) and E (XML protocols + FP catalog) are heuristic — they bias the model but cannot guarantee behavior. Full breakdown in [ARCHITECTURE.md §1](ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Does this work with Cursor / Codex / OpenCode?
The XML protocols and false-positive catalog are plain Markdown — any AI that reads MD can use them. But the hook system, subagent tool scoping, and path-scoped rules are Claude Code 2026 features. Without them you lose the deterministic layers.

### Why the brain metaphor?
It's a mnemonic — "BRAIN routes, CRAFT refactors, PERF measures" — not a cognitive claim. MD files are documents read by a language model. See [ARCHITECTURE.md §8](ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Does it work with existing `CLAUDE.md` and `memory/`?
Yes. `coexist` mode (default) preserves everything — only appends a 3-line bootstrap reference to your CLAUDE.md. The `memory/` folder is detected and left untouched.

### npm install vs plugin marketplace?
- **npm install**: gets you **everything** — the root protocols (BRAIN.md / CRAFT.md / PERF.md), path-scoped rules, settings template, plus the plugin components.
- **Plugin marketplace**: gets you **only the plugin components** — subagents, slash commands, hook. Path-scoped rules and root-level protocols can't be packaged as a plugin, so they stay user-level.

For full stetkeep behavior, use npm install. For lightweight subagent access, plugin install is enough.

### Why the name "stetkeep"?
`stet` (Latin: *"let it stand"*) is the traditional editorial mark an editor writes over proposed deletions to cancel them and preserve the original text. `stetkeep` applies the same principle to code: tell Claude to leave your intentional code alone.

Two unrelated prior uses of "stet" exist in tech history: an IBM VM/CMS text editor from 1977 by Mike Cowlishaw (now historical, no active maintenance) and STET SA, a European payment processor (B2B, unrelated domain). stetkeep is neither of those. The name reclaims the original editorial meaning for AI-era code editing.

This project was originally launched as `mdbrain` on 2026-04-19, but was renamed to `stetkeep` one day later after discovering a brand conflict with mediaire's `mdbrain` medical AI software. See [CHANGELOG v0.4.0](CHANGELOG.md) for the full story.

### Built with AI?
Yes. Designed by [CJ Kim](https://github.com/chanjoongx) in iteration with Claude. The protocol's own Safety Net caught multiple attempts where Claude proposed to "improve" the protocol in self-defeating ways — which is exactly the kind of false-positive editing stetkeep is built to prevent.
